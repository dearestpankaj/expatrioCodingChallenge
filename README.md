## Getting Started
The flutter application is built with clean architecture.

Clean Architecture
𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of different layers within the app.

- 𝗗𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿: Contains your business logic and entities.
- 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿: Manages data access and storage.
- 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿: Handles UI and user interactions.

The app is divided in modules which are again further distributed as per above folder structure.

Note: Although I have integrated save tax api, the data is not being saved in the database. I also checked it in Postman but there as well nothing is being saved. But since I am getting 200 in status code I am just assuming that api is not actually saving the data.
